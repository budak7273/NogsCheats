## New Stuff

## Changed Stuff

- Clients are now allowed to run console commands via the `/c` chat command
  - Previously only the host player would be allowed and others would be silently rejected
- Trying to use `/c` when the mod configs have it disabled now prints a message ("Console Chat Commands are disabled in the NogsCheats mod configs")

## Bugfixes

- Fixed some confusing colors for chat command execution results
