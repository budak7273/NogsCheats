## For Developers

If you though this mod died with Update 4, you were wrong!
It looks like somewhere between Update 5 and and 8 the field that had to be made visible via an engine header edit is now publicly accessible, so this mod is back in business!

The source code is now accessible at <https://github.com/budak7273/NogsCheats>.
